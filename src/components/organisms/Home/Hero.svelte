                    Originally, chamber music referred to a type of classical music that was performed in a small space such as a house or a palace room.
                    There were far fewer instruments then found in an orchestra and no conductor to guide the musicians.
                    Today, the tradition of chamber music remains very similar to its origins in terms of the size of the venue and the number of instruments used.
                    Typically, a chamber orchestra is composed of 40 or fewer musicians.
                    Because of the limited number of instruments, each instrument plays an equally important role.
